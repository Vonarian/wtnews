WinSet_Click_Through - Makes a window unclickable. Written by Wicked & SKAN.
I - ID of the window to set as unclickable.
T - The transparency to set the window. Leaving it blank will set it to 254. It can also be set On or Off. Any numbers lower then 0 or greater then 254 will simply be changed to 254.
If the window ID doesn't exist, it returns 0.
